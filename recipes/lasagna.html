    <h3>Cooking method</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><h4>Cooking lasagna pasta</h4></li>
        <p>Boil water until boiling in teflon and pour a tablespoon of cooking oil. While waiting for the water to boil, prepare a flat plate as wide as pasta, pour ice water on a plate.

            After the water boils in the Teflon, add the lasagna sheets one by one. Cook until al dente , about 7 minutes. Don't cook it for too long because the texture of the pasta can turn soft and break easily during preparation.
            
            How to find al dente , you have to try to lift the pasta a little and take a bite. If it still has the taste of raw pasta, boil it longer.
            
            After the pasta is cooked, drain the cooking water. Place the cooked pasta sheets in a shallow dish filled with ice water.
            
            Do not skip this process, as the pasta may stick to each other if not soaked in ice water.</p>

        <li><h4>Cooking red sauce</h4></li>
        <p>Pour enough cooking oil then sauté the onions or shallots and garlic.

            Enter the ground beef, cook until half cooked, add one tomato that has been cut into small pieces.
            
            Sauté until the meat is cooked and the tomatoes are mushy, add the spaghetti bolognese sauce. Add salt, pepper and oregano to taste. When it is cooked and the sauce is boiling, set aside on a plate.</p>

        <li><h4>Cooking bechamel sauce</h4></li>
        <p>It is important to use non-stick pots or pans in this process.

            First, pour the milk in a bowl, add two tablespoons of flour, grated cheddar cheese, salt, pepper, and oregano to taste. Mix well in a bowl.
            
            Heat a non-stick pan, add a tablespoon of margarine and melt it. When you have poured the contents of the bowl into the saucepan, stir continuously until it thickens.
            
            If it's not thick enough, add a tablespoon of cornstarch. But if you feel it's thick enough, don't add more cornstarch.
            
            When the sauce is boiling and thick, set it aside.</p>

        <li><h4>Arrange the lasagna</h4></li>
        <p>Prepare a long baking sheet (can be a cake pan, bread pan, heat-resistant ceramic baking sheet, or disposable aluminum foil) measuring about 15 cm long.

            First layer, add about 2 tablespoons of red meat sauce, cover the surface of the pan. On top, place one sheet of cooked lasagna pasta. Cut the pasta if it doesn't fit the pan.
            
            Over the pasta, drizzle about two tablespoons of the bechamel sauce, then over the sauce drizzle some quick melt cheese.
            
            Arrange continuously until the top of the baking sheet is covered with quick melt cheese.
            
            In assembling, estimate the portion of the red sauce and bechamel sauce to fit over the top of the baking sheet.</p>

        <li><h4>Bake lasagna</h4></li>
        <p>Bake the lasagna in the oven at 180 degrees Celsius for 30-45 minutes (depending on the oven).

            How to know if the lasagna is ready to be removed from the oven, its shape is solid (slightly deflated), looks a bit dry, and smells very good.
            
            Let the lasagna air (can be left in the oven) for 15 minutes. Don't eat it right away because the pan is very hot and the sauce hasn't set or absorbed completely.</p>
